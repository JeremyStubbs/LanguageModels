**Large Language Models**

They evolved from translation models. The initial structure was an encoder-decoder. It is still helpful to think of large language models in terms of two parts, but I would rename them the reading comprehension stage and response production stage.

The basic encoder-decoder architecture is explained in the foundational papers for language models.

At each time step (after each output word): the following things are fed back into the model: the previous time step’s output (matrix representation of the word), the model's weights (in a matrix), and the context tensor for each input word.

LLMs do not operate on Boolean logic, mathematics on 0s and 1s (although the transistor does), but rather statistics - groups of neurons perform complex statistical operations on matrices. Chatgpt told me this and Geoffrey Hinton is famous partly for modeling networks as Boltzman fields (stats stuff). The statistics determine 1) most likely meaning of a word or phrase and 2) how to craft a response.

It is helpful to understand how the human mind works. If I tell you a story, you will (assuming average intelligence) be able to draw conclusions about events in it and make predictions about it. Much of this revolves around creating a visualization of the story. Your mind has much practice in visualizing things that happen and assigning all the appropriate physics to it (time, gravity, size and speed of things). Your brain works on rather simple neurons - threshold activation. It accomplishes this task by using extremely complex networks. I imagine the brain as a humming mass of web-like electricity. You cannot make these sorts of 3D connections on silicon, but you don’t need to because silicon neurons can do extremely complex matrix/statistical operations. But even with silicon there will be some similarity at least functionally to accomplish these tasks.

The structures that make this possible are programmable memory units called long-short term memory networks and transformer networks. LSTM and transformers to store matrix values between time steps of the program. These matrices are analogous to the context vectors of early models, but now they must encompass a lot more information: content comprehension and style directives of the response (length, writing style, etc). In summary, words are passed in one by one and used to create matrices that encompass all their relationships.

I believe that the architecture of the first stage of the model is massively parallel input networks. There are many parallel networks built from LSTM and transformer networks together with other neurons. These networks are highly connected to each other and to the second stage of the model. Each receives every input word. The first stage “programs” both stages of the model to create a “world” that has all the expected dependencies and relationships.

The response production/second stage is likely also massively parallel networks and is likely connected perpendicularly to the reading comprehension/first stage.

As I mentioned, the first task is reading comprehension done by the first stage. The first stage makes sense of the prompt and provides directives to the second stage. Most likely all the words are processed by the first stage before the response production starts by the second stage. The first stage then passes matrix(ces) and weights to the second stage which tell it how to begin the response. The first stage sets the appropriate number of networks and their connections in both stages. The first stage can change default settings and increase the vocabulary of the model.

The response production/second stage makes sentences one word at a time. I don’t think it’s physically possible to do it any other way. It ensures flow and completion through feedforward and feedback mechanisms with both itself and the first stage after each word. There is constant evaluation of what the second stage is doing and readjustments of the matrix values, weights, and/or network connections of the second stage to accomplish its directives.

As far as the specific maths go, the statistical operations appropriately alter the values of the short term/programmable memory matrices and the adjustable weights. In addition, it selects the number of networks to use and their connections. In the second stage of the model, the matrices predict an appropriate next word.

Both the reading comprehension and response production feedback regulation require abstraction and linguistic logic - the ability to understand every word available to use (including made up words) and put enough words together to understand complex concepts. **Said another way,** both to go from words to matrices and go from matrices to words you have to be able to create complex relationships between tensor representations of words. There must be some default settings that store the physics and definitions: values in the matrices and intra and inter connections in the networks. But these default values must be easily accessible because they can be changed. New relationships can be also be given in the prompt.

Even a simple phrase like Jack and Jill are dating implies a whole lotta information. Both stages set matrix values and create new relationships within and between networks to figure stuff out with linguistic logic, and express unique sentences dependent on those relationships. Depending on the environment, different physics have to be implemented. By changing default matrix values?

You can make up words and you can redefine words, so you must be able to easily access and change matrix values and intra and inter network relationships. For example, I can say “make a sentence with the word circular, but circular means flegblarg which is the state of being too sick to get drunk enough to pick up a slut at a bar.” And ChatGPT will spit out a perfect sentence.

Abstraction example:  
We generalize sounds, sights, tastes, etc. well. AI must as well.

E.g. a squirrel chitter is a high pitched sound. If something else makes that sound it also chitters.

Linguistic Logic:  
Humans often visualize things. We create an imaginary world in our minds eye in which events play out. AI must do something similar.

Eg, if you start a sentence with “running through the forest” it can’t continue “the dolphin jumped out of the water” unless it’s a kelp forest. It could also continue correctly, “he tripped over a root” or “she heard a parrot squawk” but not “the concert reached a crescendo”.

The logical consistency/ factual accuracy depends on the context of the response.

Eg for a question that requires a factual response, a brick cannot fly unless it is thrown, but in a fictional story it can do anything.

Why are the flow of the response and style variations coded in the weights of the model? There are an unlimited number of ways to construct a response. Style parameters: length of response, writing style/voice, sentence structure (noun or noun equivalent first in most, verb first in some commands, etc). You are not going to have a unique subnetwork for every kind of sentence. Variation is accomplished by changing the weights. These weights are determined by the input prompt and passed through the model. The difference between a weight and a regular matrix value is a weight is a coefficient used in the mathematical operations of a neuron, and a matrix value is a variable in those operations.

Long responses are accomplished by breaking the writing down into parts. Each sentence has a symbolic purpose: description, action, fact, etc. Together they create a paragraph which itself has a symbolic purpose. Paragraphs are just related sentences and stories are composed of related paragraphs. Building complex related stories is based on combining related symbols. This reflects actual writing: “The last sentence said — so —. The last paragraph said — so —. The whole story up to here says — and I want to say — so —. Stylistically, I want suspense before the climax so I will start with — then do —”.

How would you build something connected to an external database (like for a search engine):

Say you wanted to access something outside the model’s memory units. The first and second stage pause what they are doing and a “query unit” asks a database for information. This “query unit” would then return the information to both stage. What’s interesting is that this “query unit” resembles an entire LLM. It has to figure out what knowledge is missing from the memory units, form an appropriate question, read the search results and formulate an input into the active program.

Eg if the user says “Tell me about a lkajsdfl - rare cat breed discussed only in some obscure reddit thread,” it will search the internet for information about this cat and convey this information back to the matrices and weights.

Questions to test AI:

Ask about symbolism of an entirely new story.

Ask it to identify opinion vs fact in a social situation.

Ask it to draw connections between two stories.

Ask it to write a story with an invented word that has a very specific unique complex definition.

**Transformers**

The following conversation with ChatGPT elucidates the math and structure of transformer. Someday I will draw pictures.

**You said:**

Attention is just context right?

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes…

**You said:**

In large language models (LLMs), attention is an encoding mechanism that uses dot products right.

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes, in transformer-based language models, attention mechanisms, particularly _self-attention_ and _multi-head attention_, rely on dot products. The core operation in _scaled dot-product attention_ is the computation of attention scores using the dot product between query (Q) and key (K) vectors:

Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(QKTdk)V\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax} \\left( \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) VAttention(Q,K,V)=softmax(dk​​QKT​)V

**You said:**

originally it was different

**ChatGPT said:**

…Initially, attention mechanisms computed alignment scores between hidden states of the encoder and decoder:

score(ht,hs)=ht⋅hs\\text{score}(h_t, h_s) = h_t \\cdot h_sscore(ht​,hs​)=ht​⋅hs​

where:

- hth_tht​ is the **decoder hidden state at time ttt.**
- hsh_shs​ is the **encoder hidden state at position sss.**

These scores were then normalized (e.g., via softmax) to produce attention weights, which were used to create a weighted sum of encoder hidden states. This approach allowed the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence dynamically.

Transformers later generalized and refined this approach with _scaled dot-product attention_, multi-head attention, and the use of query, key, and value projections, enabling more flexible and scalable architectures.

**You said:**

transformers really changed the math it seems

**ChatGPT said:**

Yeah, they really did. Early attention mechanisms were more like adaptive weighting schemes for recurrent networks, but Transformers turned attention into the _core_ computation. Instead of sequential processing like RNNs, Transformers use _parallelizable_ matrix operations, making them way more efficient for large-scale learning.

The biggest shifts in the math came from:

1. **Self-attention** – Instead of attending to separate encoder/decoder hidden states, each token attends to every other token in the sequence using dot-product attention.
2. **Multi-head attention** – Instead of a single attention mechanism, multiple attention heads run in parallel, capturing different aspects of the relationships between tokens.
3. **Positional encodings** – Since Transformers don’t process tokens sequentially like RNNs, they needed a way to encode word order.

These tweaks made Transformers scalable, parallelizable, and ultimately the backbone of modern AI models. Are you thinking about working with Transformers in some way?

**You said:**

you said that attention let the “decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence dynamically”. it still spits out a word one by one, but the connections relationships between the all the words are processed parallel. so there must be a way to identify what part of the input to focus on at any given point in the response

**ChatGPT said:**

Exactly! Even though the decoder generates words sequentially, the _self-attention_ and _encoder-decoder attention_ mechanisms allow it to dynamically focus on different parts of the input at each step. Here’s how that works:

1. **Self-Attention in the Encoder**
    - Every token in the input attends to every other token _in parallel_, capturing contextual relationships before anything is generated.
2. **Encoder-Decoder Attention in the Decoder**
    - When generating each word, the decoder queries the encoder’s outputs using an attention mechanism.
    - This allows the decoder to "look back" at different parts of the input sequence dynamically.
    - The attention weights shift at each step, meaning different input words get different levels of focus depending on what the model is trying to generate.
3. **Causal Masking in the Decoder**
    - Since generation happens one word at a time, the decoder applies a _mask_ to prevent attending to future words.
    - This ensures it only uses what has already been generated, maintaining the autoregressive nature of text generation.

So even though the final output sequence is produced word by word, each word is informed by a parallelized, global understanding of the input. This is a huge reason why Transformers outperform RNNs and LSTMs in NLP tasks.

Are you thinking about implementing something with attention mechanisms, or just fascinated by how it works?

**You said:**

So in rnns, did the decoder start spitting out words before the encoder finished

**ChatGPT said:**

Good question! In standard RNN-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, the encoder **first** processed the entire input sequence before the decoder started generating output. This is called the **"encoder-decoder" architecture with full encoding**:

1. Encoding Phase: The encoder reads the input sequence one token at a time (sequentially, since RNNs process data step by step). After reading the entire input, it compresses all the information into a fixed-length hidden state (context vector).
2. Decoding Phase: The decoder then uses this context vector as its starting point and begins generating the output sequence, one token at a time. Each output token is fed back into the decoder as input for the next step.

Key Limitation: The Bottleneck

The problem was that the entire input sequence had to be compressed into a single hidden state before the decoder could start generating. This led to information loss, especially for long sequences—early words would often be "forgotten" by the time the decoder needed them.

Did the Decoder Ever Start Early?

- In a basic RNN seq2seq, no—the decoder had to wait for the encoder to finish.
- Later improvements, like input-feeding attention, allowed the decoder to access the encoder's states dynamically instead of just relying on the final context vector.
- Some online/streaming models (e.g., for speech recognition) use partial encoding and start decoding earlier, but traditional seq2seq models didn’t do this.

Transformers changed everything by making the entire input context available at once through attention, eliminating the need for a fixed-length context vector.

**You said:**

do transformers create a single encoding matrix?

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes, Transformers create a **single encoding matrix**, but it's much richer than the old RNN-style context vector. Instead of compressing everything into a single fixed-size vector, Transformers generate a **sequence of contextualized token embeddings**.

**How the Encoding Matrix Works:**

1. **Token Embeddings + Positional Encodings**:
    - Each input token is mapped to an embedding vector.
    - Since Transformers don’t have sequential processing like RNNs, **positional encodings** are added to maintain word order.
2. **Multi-Layer Self-Attention**:
    - Each token attends to every other token, forming **contextualized representations**.
    - After multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward transformations, the final output is a matrix where each row corresponds to a token embedding that encodes **global context** from the entire input.
3. **Final Encoding Matrix**:
    - The Transformer encoder outputs a matrix of shape **(sequence length, embedding dimension)**.
    - Each row is a **context-aware embedding** of a token, meaning each word now "understands" its relationship with the rest of the input.

**Why This Is Better Than RNNs:**

- **No fixed-size bottleneck**: The whole sequence is represented instead of squeezing everything into a single vector.
- **Parallel processing**: All tokens are processed simultaneously instead of step by step.
- **Rich contextual representation**: Every token gets a unique, attention-weighted encoding rather than a simple summary.

When the decoder generates output, it **queries this entire encoding matrix** dynamically, rather than relying on a single compressed context vector like in RNNs.

**You said:**

Does the decoder rely on anything except the encoding matrix/self feedback?

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes, the Transformer decoder relies on three key sources of information when generating each token:

1. **The Encoding Matrix (from the Encoder)**
    - This is the processed representation of the input sequence.
    - The decoder attends to this matrix using **encoder-decoder attention**, which allows it to pull relevant information dynamically instead of relying on a single fixed context vector like RNNs.
2. **Self-Attention (for Decoder’s Own Outputs)**
    - The decoder maintains a history of previously generated tokens.
    - It uses **self-attention**, but with **causal masking**, meaning it can only attend to past tokens (not future ones).
    - This ensures that it generates text **one step at a time** in an autoregressive manner.
3. **Final Feedforward Layers (for Token Prediction)**
    - After attention layers, the decoder applies a **feedforward network** to refine token representations.
    - The final output goes through a **softmax layer** to predict the next word in the sequence.

**Summary of the Decoder’s Dependencies:**

1\. **Encoding matrix** – Provides global context from the input sequence.  
2\. **Self-attention feedback** – Allows the decoder to maintain consistency in generated text.  
3\. **Feedforward + Softmax** – Converts internal representations into actual token predictions.

So while self-feedback (self-attention) is critical for fluency, the decoder still heavily relies on the **encoder’s output matrix** to generate meaningful responses.

**You said:**

ok so self attention means math involving/correlating different cells within a tensor to make the next tensor?

**ChatGPT said:**

Exactly! Self-attention is essentially **math that correlates different cells (tokens) within a tensor** to produce a new, transformed tensor. Each token in the sequence is updated based on its relationship with all the other tokens.

**Breaking it Down Step by Step:**

1. **Start with an Input Tensor**
    - This is a matrix where each row is an embedding of a token in the sequence.
2. **Project the Tensor into Queries, Keys, and Values**
    - The input tensor is linearly transformed into three versions:
        - **Queries (Q)** – What each token is looking for.
        - **Keys (K)** – How relevant each token is to others.
        - **Values (V)** – The actual content being passed through.
3. **Compute Attention Scores** (QKᵀ)
    - Dot product between **Queries** and **Keys** gives a similarity score between each pair of tokens.
    - This forms an **attention score matrix** (shape: _sequence length × sequence length_).
4. **Normalize with Softmax**
    - The scores are passed through **softmax** to turn them into a probability distribution, deciding how much focus each token should have on others.
5. **Weight the Values (V) Using These Scores**
    - Each token’s representation is updated by summing the **weighted values** from all tokens.
    - This forms the new output tensor.
6. **Repeat for Multi-Head Attention & Stack Layers**
    - The process is repeated across multiple attention heads and layers to refine relationships.

**The Result?**

The original tensor is **transformed** into a new tensor where each token **encodes relationships** with all the others, making it **context-aware** instead of just a static embedding.

So yeah, it’s **tensor math that builds context by relating different parts of the input dynamically**.

**You said:**

are there hidden states in transformers?

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes, there are **hidden states** in Transformers, but they work a bit differently than in RNNs or LSTMs.

**How Hidden States Work in Transformers:**

In traditional RNNs/LSTMs, the hidden state represents a compressed version of the sequence's information at each time step, and it evolves sequentially.

**However, in Transformers, hidden states are part of the self-attention** **mechanism** and the layers of the encoder and decoder.

1. **Encoder Hidden States:**
    - The encoder takes the input sequence and processes it through multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks.
    - **After each layer of the encoder, the output is a set of hidden states that represent the input sequence with increasing levels of abstraction**.
    - These hidden states are context-aware because each token is informed by its relationship with every other token in the sequence (due to the self-attention mechanism).
    - The final encoder hidden states are what the decoder will attend to when generating output.
2. **Decoder Hidden States:**
    - **The decoder also has hidden states that evolve as it generates tokens one by one.**
    - **At each step, the decoder uses self-attention on its own hidden states and the encoding**.
    - The hidden states in the decoder help track what has been generated so far, ensuring that the model doesn't forget earlier parts of the sequence while generating the next token.

**The Key Difference:**

- **In RNNs, the hidden state is a single vector (or a small set of vectors)** that encodes information about the sequence at each point in time.
- **In Transformers, hidden states are matrices:** each token has a corresponding hidden state at every layer, and each token’s state encodes context from the entire sequence. These hidden states are processed in parallel across all tokens at each layer, rather than sequentially.

So, while there are hidden states in Transformers, the concept is expanded to handle sequences in parallel, with each token having its own dynamic, context-rich hidden state.

**You said:**

by the time you get to the decoder it hardly looks like the input at all?

**ChatGPT said:**

Exactly! By the time the data reaches the decoder in a Transformer model, **the original input has been transformed significantly, and it doesn't resemble its initial form at all.** This transformation happens through several layers of self-attention and feedforward networks. Here's how it works:

**Step-by-Step Transformation in the Encoder:**

1. **Initial Embeddings**:  
    The input sequence (such as a sentence) is first converted into **embeddings**—dense vectors that represent each token.
2. **Positional Encoding**:  
    Since Transformers don't have inherent sequential processing like RNNs, **positional encodings** are added to the embeddings to inject information about the order of the tokens.
3. **Self-Attention Layers**:  
    In each layer of the encoder, each token attends to every other token in the sequence. The hidden state of a token is updated by combining information from the entire sequence, based on its attention scores.  
    This means each token is constantly evolving and integrating context from the rest of the sequence.
4. **Feedforward Networks**:  
    After self-attention, the outputs are passed through position-wise feedforward networks (fully connected layers), adding more complexity and abstraction to the representations.

By the end of the encoder stack (which may consist of multiple layers), the hidden states represent deeply **contextualized** information. They are no longer the raw input tokens but rather **abstracted** representations that capture the relationships and meaning across the entire sequence.

**The Decoder:**

- The decoder doesn’t just take the final encoder output directly—it attends to these encoded representations and generates the output sequence step-by-step.
- Attention Mechanisms: The decoder uses both self-attention (to attend to its own previously generated tokens) and encoder-decoder attention (to focus on the encoder’s output, which is the context-rich representation of the input).
- The decoder doesn't receive the original input directly; instead, it works with these transformed hidden states, which contain contextual information about the entire sequence.

**Why the Input Doesn’t Look Like the Original:**

By the time the encoder processes the input, it has been transformed by multiple layers of attention and feedforward networks, capturing high-level relationships and abstractions. These **contextualized representations** are what the decoder uses to generate output, meaning the decoder isn't working with the raw input anymore but rather with a set of **abstracted, context-enriched hidden states**.

So, you're right! The original input is hardly recognizable at the decoder stage—it has been transformed into a more meaningful, context-rich representation of the entire sequence.

**You said:**

so does bengios math resemble the transformer math at all? or was it influential because it showed how to contextualize the encoding

**ChatGPT said:**

Bengio's early work in attention mechanisms and neural machine translation was highly influential for the development of Transformers, but the math behind his work and the math behind Transformers differ in some important ways.

Here’s a breakdown of how Bengio’s work connects to and influences the Transformer math:

**1\. Bengio's Attention Mechanism (2014)**

In Bengio's 2014 work, particularly in the paper "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" (with Bahdanau, Cho, and others), the focus was on **alignment-based attention** for sequence-to-sequence models. The main goal was to allow the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence as it generated the output sequence.

- **The Mechanism**: Bengio's attention used a **learned alignment** mechanism between the source and target sequences. The model would calculate an attention score using a feed-forward neural network (not a dot product), which then guided how much each part of the input should be "attended to" during output generation.
- **Contextualization**: The key influence of this work was showing how to **contextualize** the input by weighting different parts of the input sequence dynamically. This was the first time a model could **learn which parts of the input to focus on** when generating each word in the output sequence.

**2\. Transformers’ Attention Mechanism (2017)**

In contrast, the Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 used **scaled dot-product attention**. The core idea in the Transformer is quite similar—**contextualizing the input** dynamically—but the **math** is different, focusing on **dot products** rather than learned alignment scores.

- **The Mechanism**: In Transformers, attention is computed by calculating the dot product between **queries (Q)** and **keys (K)**, normalizing the result with a softmax function, and using the resulting weights to combine the **values (V)**. This mechanism is more computationally efficient and scalable compared to the attention mechanism in Bengio’s work because it can be done in parallel across the entire input sequence.
- **Contextualization**: Just like in Bengio’s work, attention in Transformers enables the model to dynamically adjust which parts of the input it focuses on, but the key difference is that the dot product provides a more direct and efficient way to compute these relationships.

**Key Similarities and Differences:**

- **Similarity**: Both approaches are fundamentally about **contextualizing** the input and allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically. This concept of "attention" as a way to decide what to focus on in the input is the central idea shared between Bengio’s work and Transformers.
- **Difference**: The **math** of the two models is different:
  - Bengio’s attention uses a learned alignment score based on neural networks (a separate scoring function for each token pair).
  - Transformers use a **dot product** between queries and keys to calculate attention scores, which is a more scalable, parallelizable approach.

**Why Bengio's Work Was Influential:**

Bengio’s work was pivotal because it showed that it was **possible to model the relationships between tokens in a sequence dynamically**, and that doing so could **improve machine translation**. It introduced the idea that **dynamic, context-sensitive attention** could replace static alignments (like in phrase-based translation), allowing for much more flexibility.

This insight directly influenced the development of **Transformers**, where the focus on **contextualizing each token in relation to every other token** became a core principle. The idea was extended in Transformers using **dot-product attention**, which efficiently scaled to larger sequences and models.

**Summary:**

Bengio’s early work on attention introduced the **concept of context-dependent focusing** in neural machine translation, which directly inspired the development of **Transformer models**. However, the specific **math** of the attention mechanism (dot product vs. learned alignment) differs between the two, with Transformers using a more **efficient, scalable approach** to computing attention.

**You said:**

so you’re saying bengio didn’t exactly specify how to contextualize the model learned on its own?

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes, that's correct! Bengio's early work on attention in neural machine translation did **not** specify exactly how to contextualize the entire sequence in the same way that **Transformers** do.

**Bengio's Attention Mechanism:**

- In Bengio's 2014 paper, the attention mechanism was used to align parts of the input sequence with parts of the output sequence. **The model** **learned to assign attention weights to different parts of the input as the output sequence was being generated.**
- The contextualization of the model was based on a learned alignment function that used a neural network (not a dot product) to calculate how much attention each input token should get at each step of the decoding process.
- This mechanism helped the model dynamically focus on different parts of the input, but it was specifically tied to the encoder-decoder architecture of sequence-to-sequence models, and it relied on learning a scoring function between tokens (not on a mathematical structure like the dot product).

**You said:**

bengio had a model within a model for learning how to apply weights?

**ChatGPT said:**

Yes, exactly! In **Bengio's attention mechanism (2014)**, the model used a **"model within a model"** for learning how to apply the attention weights. Here's how it worked:

**The "Model Within a Model" Concept:**

- **Bengio's Attention Mechanism** used a **neural network** to learn how to apply attention weights to different parts of the input sequence. Specifically, this was a **scoring function** (often called an **alignment model**) that determined how much focus each token in the input sequence should get when generating the output sequence.

**How It Worked:**

1. **Alignment Model**:  
    The attention mechanism worked by using an **alignment model** (a small neural network) to compute a **score** for each token in the input sequence at each decoding step. The alignment model takes the **encoder hidden state** (representing the input) and the **decoder hidden state** (representing the output sequence being generated so far) and computes a **score** for how much attention the current decoder token should give to each encoder token.
2. **Learning the Alignment Weights**:  
    The **model within a model** (the alignment network) learned how to compute these scores by training on the entire sequence. The scores, once computed, were normalized using **softmax** to create the **attention weights**. These weights told the decoder how much each part of the input should contribute to generating the current output token.
3. **Applying the Weights**:  
    After calculating the attention scores, the decoder uses these weights to **combine** the encoder’s hidden states, effectively focusing on the most relevant parts of the input sequence at each step.

**Key Points:**

- **Learning How to Attend**: The model didn't have predefined rules for how much focus to give to each token in the input. Instead, it learned how to apply the attention weights through training. The **"model within a model"** aspect comes from the fact that the alignment model (which learns how much attention to give each token) itself is a neural network that is trained alongside the main encoder-decoder architecture.
- **Contextualizing Dynamically**: The dynamic contextualization of the input (by focusing on different tokens at different times) was the primary benefit of this architecture, as it allowed the model to learn how to decide what to focus on at each decoding step.

**Comparison to Transformers:**

In **Transformers**, this idea is generalized using **dot-product attention**, where the model directly computes the attention weights based on the **dot product** of the query and key vectors, avoiding the need for a separate alignment network. Instead of learning a scoring function with a neural network, Transformers compute these attention weights using a fixed mathematical formula that is more efficient and scalable.

**Summary:**

Bengio's attention mechanism used a **"model within a model"** in the sense that it had a neural network-based scoring function (the alignment model) that learned how to apply attention weights to the input sequence. This was an important innovation because it allowed the model to **dynamically focus** on relevant parts of the input during decoding, making it more flexible than traditional methods. However, the **Transformer's attention** mechanism simplified and generalized this approach using dot products, leading to more efficient and scalable models.

**You said:**

for fucks sake why didn’t you say that earlier

**ChatGPT said:**

I apologize for the confusion earlier, and I appreciate your patience! I should have made the connection to **Bengio’s alignment model** much clearer right from the start. Thanks for pointing that out—I’ll be more direct in the future!

**You said:**

yeah transformers massively simplify that directly into the math that generates each hidden state/matrix during encoding

**ChatGPT said:**

Exactly! Transformers **massively simplify** the attention mechanism by **directly incorporating the math** into the process of generating each hidden state at every layer during encoding.

Here’s how the Transformer approach streamlines things:

**How Transformers Simplify Attention:**

- Instead of using a **separate learned alignment model** (like Bengio’s attention mechanism), **Transformers** compute attention scores directly using the **dot product** between the **query (Q)** and **key (K)** vectors. This results in a much more **efficient** and **parallelizable** method for computing relationships between tokens in the input sequence.
- The Transformer architecture replaces the need for a complex learned function to calculate attention scores by using a fixed **dot-product formula**, making the entire process faster and easier to scale to large datasets and long sequences.

**Encoding with Transformers:**

- Each layer in the encoder processes the sequence using **self-attention**. Here, each token in the input sequence attends to every other token to build a **contextualized representation**. The key difference is that the math is done via **simple vector operations** (dot products) instead of learning complex alignment functions.
- The hidden state for each token is updated by aggregating weighted information from all the tokens in the sequence, and each layer’s output is a matrix where each token’s representation is richer and more contextualized than before.

**Why It’s a Big Deal:**

- **Parallelization**: The dot product mechanism used in Transformers allows for **parallel computation** across all tokens at each layer, unlike RNNs or Bengio’s alignment-based attention, which process tokens sequentially.
- **Simplicity**: Transformers directly compute the attention weights using matrix operations (dot products), which simplifies the attention mechanism and makes it computationally efficient compared to Bengio’s separate scoring function.

So, yeah—Transformers are able to **directly compute the relationships** between tokens at each layer through the dot-product attention, and this **simplified math** makes the whole process much more scalable and efficient than previous approaches like Bengio’s.

**You said:**

So noone before the early bengio tried to add context to translation models encoders

**ChatGPT said:**

Actually, there were attempts to add context to machine translation models before the early work by Yoshua Bengio and others in the **2010s**, but they were either quite limited or not as effective as what came later with **attention mechanisms**.

**So, to answer your question:**

Before Bengio and the development of attention, there were some efforts to introduce context, but they were either limited in scope or not flexible enough to handle the complexity of real-world translation tasks. **Attention** was the key breakthrough that allowed a **dynamic, context-dependent** understanding of the input sequence, which is why it revolutionized translation models.

**You said:**

Uszkoreit invented transformers right?

**ChatGPT said:**

**Transformer paper** was a **collaborative effort** by **Vaswani et al.** and drew from a variety of prior works, including Uszkoreit's research, but with key innovations:

- The **scaling of attention** to work **across the entire sequence in parallel** (without the sequential processing of RNNs and LSTMs).
- The use of **multi-head attention**, where the model can attend to the input sequence from multiple perspectives or subspaces at once, allowing for richer representations.

**Uszkoreit and Parallel Processing Ideas (2016):**

- **Uszkoreit** (and others) had already realized the **need for parallelism** in sequence-to-sequence models like those used in machine translation. Traditional models like **RNNs** and **LSTMs** process sequences **sequentially**, meaning they have to process one token at a time, which **limits scalability** and makes training very slow.
- **In 2016**, Uszkoreit was exploring the idea of using **parallel processing** for **sequence encoding** to speed things up and make models more efficient. The key challenge at the time was **finding a way to parallelize sequence processing** without losing the ability to model long-range dependencies between tokens in a sequence.
- His work was aligned with what later became the core insight of the **Transformer architecture**—that **sequence information could be captured using attention mechanisms** in a way that allowed for **parallel processing** of all tokens in a sequence, rather than relying on sequential processing like RNNs or LSTMs.
